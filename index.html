        <div class="subheading mb-5"> SociologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"> At the moment, I am 18 years old. I was born in Monterey Park, California on August 4, 2001.I come from two immigrant parents, Nancy and Pedro, who were both born in Mexico. They both never finished school, but instead crossed the border in search for a better life.They had two kids, one being my older brother, Pedro, and me being the youngest.I grew up in the city of Montclair, California. Softball and music became a big part of my life. Both of these childhood hobbies showed me teamwork and patience.<br><br>

        Ever since the age of 16, I  became employed. I  started off with the typical first job, Mcdonalds. It helped me with my communication skills and my work ethic.It also helped me with becoming professional due to the different customer experiences that would occur.It brought me a different experience every day. I  was handling a job and also involvement at school.I graduated from Montclair High School in 2019. In high school, I was involved in the Associated Student Body (ASB). Throughout my last two years in ASB, I held executive positions. My junior year, I was in charge of the clubs on campus and social outings outside of school. It helped everyone feel welcomed and made school less irritable. My senior year I was involved in charge of the media. I learned how to create flyers, manage videos, manage audio, and how to promote on social media. One of my favorite things we did was create different activities for our special ed kids on campus.It made them feel welcomed and loved. I became fond of making people smile and making a difference in their lives.<br><br>

        After high school, I decided to attend the University of California in Riverside.I am the first in my family to go to a university. This means I am considered first generation. I am majoring in Sociology in hopes of becoming part of the Child Protective Services. I am looking to provide assistance and make a difference in the well-being of the youth. At the beginning, I  was not sure whether I wanted to become a kindergarten teacher or a teacher in general. All I  really knew was that I was very fond of kids. I  wanted to make a difference somehow. Instead I became interested in social work because I would see how trauma and abuse would affect a child. I am a strong believer in people deserving to reach their true potential without the unfairness they have to face. In the meantime, I am employed at Target which helps me express my creativity and love for makeup and skincare. It has opened me up to becoming informative and learning how to fit everyoneâ€™s specific needs. Little by little, every opportunity has been able to teach me different skills in life.<br><br>
